#Changes done

1. Refactored the code for easier maintenance and reusability. Added Item class for items pulled from API endpoint. Used TypeAdapterGenerator for easier access between DB and program. Fixed typo errors to instantiate class correctly.
2. Added widgets folder for accessing widgets for view. Added dial for toggling between ListView and GridView.
3. Added controller folder for creating GetxController to be used in widgets. In ItemController created method to fetch items using endpoint and toggling variable for grid/list.
4. Added toggle for dark mode. By my testing it doesn't work on windows.
5.
